        12-week, full-time course that covered the fundamentals of full-stack web development. The course
        was fully remote so I utilised Zoom and Slack for daily stand-ups, lessons, labs, pair-coding and
        project work. For more details on my projects, click through to <a href="#projects">Projects, here</a>
